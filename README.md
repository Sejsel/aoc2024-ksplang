# Advent of Code 2024 in ksplang

Solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) written in
the [ksplang](https://github.com/ksp/ksplang) programming language. Or rather, the programs used to generate
ksplang programs. And programs used to generate programs used to generate ksplang programs.


> [!NOTE]
> Figuring out how to use ksplang is actually an exceptionally nice puzzle and I would recommend you read none
> of the code in this repository before you try to solve [first tasks](https://github.com/ksp/ksplang/blob/master/ksplang_en.md#tasks)
> such as adding a zero to the stack yourself. It's a fun challenge.
> 
> It can then be expanded into building better and better tooling for yourself
> to write more complex programs, like I have done here.
