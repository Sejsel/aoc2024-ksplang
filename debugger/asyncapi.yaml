  title: ksplang Debugger WebSocket API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    WebSocket API for the ksplang debugger that allows real-time debugging of ksplang programs.
    
    The API provides functionality to:
    - Set and modify programs
    - Control the execution stack
    - Step through program execution
    - Receive real-time state updates
